An Introduction to Task Force Everest
================================================

Foreword by the Unit Commander
-----------------------------------

Task Force Everest is a unit that took five years to take shape. Formed by members who are battle hardened from some of the best MILSIMs in the community our
goal is to provide the same incredible community to members in the EU as the US based groups provide to their members.

We like to think our approach to ARMA is somewhat unique from other groups. To start with we are unapologetic about the fact that we are a Realism MILSIM group.
We aren't semi serious, we don't think ranks are stupid - we think that the environment shapes the gameplay and we act as such.

For me the most important thing we can achieve here is a sustainable community that provides enjoyable and robustly performed MILSIM to it's members.
Achieving this goal will take time and there will be challenges but I am confident that with our uniquely high quality approach we will build a community
that we can all be proud of.
