Unit Structure
=================

Task Force Everest is modelled around a NATO Joint Task Force comprising of several units. Whilst none of the units we portray represent a direct real world
entity each has an underlying theme which drives them.

Notable variations from real life doctrine
--------------------------------------------

**No NCOs above the platoon level**

The highest level NCOs in the unit act at the Platoon level as platoon sergeants. Above this we merge the NCO role with the Executive Officer role to create a single deputy role to the Commanding Officer at that level.

Generally speaking we treat NCO positions as a pathway to the Officer Corps and therefore do not offer long term leadership progression above the platoon level to the NCO corps. This typically means that some of the most experienced people in the unit are officers as opposed to in the real army where an NCO will often have vastly more experience than the officer under whom he works.

High Level Overview
---------------------

At a high level the group consists of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company element that houses the Unit Commander and the Executive Officer - the two highest ranking officials in the unit. HHC also houses the Staff Departments and is directly responsible for their operations and rostering.

Beneath HHC the unit is divided into combat elements which are on of a platoon size infantry elements or a detachment formation such as an aviation squadron or cavalry platoon. The exact number of platoons and detached forces varies as the size of the unit fluctuates however we aim to maintain at least the following as a minimum deployment capability:

* 1 Fully Staffed Infantry Platoon
* 1 Squadron of Rotary Aviation
* 1 Platoon of Mechanised Vehicles
* 1 ODA Team

Each of these combat elements has an Officer In Charge ( typically something between an O1 and a O3 depending on the size and seniority of the formation ) as well as an NCO or Warrant Officer in charge who acts as a second in command. Elements at this level are independently responsible for maintaining their own combat readiness including rostering, promotion, training and discipline.

The general formations are outlined below with more detailed operational information available in the relevant subsections of the field manual for each element.

An Infantry Platoon
---------------------

Infantry Platoons are formed of three sections of eight men and a command element. Each platoon maintains its own medical and JTAC capability within the command element and is responsible for maintaining these capabilities within the platoon.

The command element of an infantry platoon is composed of a Platoon Leader (PL), a Platoon Sergeant (PSG), a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) and a Platoon Medic (PMED). Whilst not fulfilling their specialist roles the JTAC and Medic operate as a Security Detail for the Platoon Leader.

Below the Platoon Command Element are three infantry squads consisting of two sections of four personnel. Infantry personnel can receive training in a diverse array of specialist abilities and will carry the special equipment required to fulfill their assigned role such as a grenade launcher, Squad Automatic Weapons or medical supplies.

Most infantry training is delivered at the squad level through a structured progression system. All training is designed to focus on groups instead of individuals to ensure that players always have peers they can work with and get to know.

Rotary Aviation
-----------------

Rotary Aviation squadrons consist of four aircraft of two personnel: A pilot and a copilot. We do not allocate ground or weapons crew at this time although we may in the future pending interest from players in fulfilling the role.

Aircraft operate in squadrons and report to the Squadron Commanding Officer. Squadron's will also have an Executive Officer who is the 2IC of the squadron and will normally fly in a seperate aircraft to provide a facility for succession of command in the event an aircraft is lost or otherwise unable to continue.

Cavalry
--------

A Cavalry platoon is comprised of four vehicles with each vehicle having a Gunner, Driver and Commander. The platoon leader will lead one of the vehicles and the platoon sergeant will lead another.
